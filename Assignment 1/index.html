            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>

            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="test3"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>  
            because this easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>

            When comparing CSS class vs ID, the diffrence is that CSS class applies a style multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also 
            special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.

        <div class="tpt">
            In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the 
            element.
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        <div class="tmt">
            There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
